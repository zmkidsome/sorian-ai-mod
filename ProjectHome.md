## Please Note ##
Since this mod **cannot** yet be made Mod Manager compatible it will always be on. If you would like to play with people who are not using the mod or watch replays where the mod was not being used you must either remove the included .scd files or change their [file extension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_extension) to something like: .dontuse

Most custom maps do not include the new FA map markers so the AI will behave strangely, if it works coherently at all.

## The AIs ##

This mod introduces 4 new AIs for Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance complete with new features, new behaviors, and many bug fixes.

**Sorian:** Kind of like the Balanced AI in SC. Good for 20x20+ maps (and sometimes 10x10)

**Sorian Rush:** Just like it sounds, a rush AI. Good for small maps like 5x5 or 10x10.

**Sorian Air:** Like the regular Sorian AI except that it focuses a lot more on Air.

**Sorian Water:** Like the regular Sorian AI except that it does not build Land at all; focuses on Air and Water.

**Sorian Turtle:** Builds up defenses and tries to tech quickly.

**Sorian Adaptive:** Picks one of the Sorian AIs based on the map and allows it to choose expansion bases based on several factors.

AI = Regular AI

AIx = Cheating AI
